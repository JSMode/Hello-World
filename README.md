# Hello-World
the jump off

Here it all is, my first tid bits of python code.  Started learning python about 8 weeks ago.  Most of my code will probably be aimed at the Linux based Raspberry Pi micro computer.. As you can see these small simple scripts or programs are me testing the Pi with various circuits to see the readings, and to fine tune the variables to get it all to work right.  The 2_Servo_test_LCD162BUTTON.py is a few pieces of code combined from various sources.  I left the comments from original author intact. But,  I made it longer, changed it around a bit, added a blue 16x2 character LCD to see if I could display the status in real time on screen.  I also added in a couple inputs, however i need to figure out a better way to have the stand-by screen on than a loop, since i have to hold button for a second until the loop comes back around to checking for the input on GPIO(17).  Its just the beginning, I have some great ideas I cant wait to translate to code.  Until next time!
                      Sincerely,
